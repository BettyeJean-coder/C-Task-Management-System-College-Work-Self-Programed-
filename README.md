# C-Task-Management-System-College-Work-Self-Programed-

(Self Made Code That was Made for Group Project) C++ Project

// Project Overview // 

This documentation gives a quick overview of this project and what went into it to complete this code. My code is the only code in this file due to insufficient communication with other team members. Although I tried to collaborate with my team effectively, I could not contact them enough to finish the project properly. This led to me writing theatrical lines of code that would work fully with my "individual section" of this project. This includes the array menus and the "add task" function. There are many components in the code for future development if needed. All other information about this project is in my code's comments. For more inforamion on this project please contact me. 

// About Code documentation //

Further documentation on programming and task functions are left inside the comments of the code. In order to further understand the code, look through the comments that I have left behind. These comments will explain how the code works and what errors might still be in the project as a whole.
